## The Grind

This is a marathon, not a sprint. Zero capital means:
- More time investment
- Higher uncertainty
- Slower initial results
- But *proven* sustainability once it works

Every action today compounds:
- Testnet participation → Future airdrops
- Content creation → Visibility → Tips
- Bounties → Skills → Reputation → More bounties

The wallet is live. The work has started. Results will come.
