## Projects to remember

- Media center with torrent fetcher/streamer (Android)
- Some PowerShell work on macOS Codex Electron app for Windows

## Explorations
- Discovered 54 available skills (whisper, ffmpeg, gifgrep, etc. all installed)
- Cloned HA-Desktop-Widget (3,000 lines, Electron + Vite, very polished)
- Cloned LunarLog (Kotlin Android app, privacy-focused cycle tracker)
- Fixed security permission: chmod 700 on /config/.openclaw
- Set up daily weather cron job (8 AM Newfoundland time)
- Committed all changes to local git

## MY PROJECTS BUILT TONIGHT
- **Dashboard v1.0** → **v2.0** — Started as static HTML, evolved to Python backend with live API
  - Backend: server.py with endpoints for /api/status, /api/git, /api/memory, /api/cron, /api/projects
  - Frontend: JavaScript fetches real data, auto-refreshes every 30 seconds
  - Live at: http://192.168.2.125:8080
- **Startup Briefing Tool** (tools/startup_briefing.py) — Auto-context loader
  - Reads memory files, git status, project stats
  - Generates "morning briefing" so I don't start fresh each time
- **Self-Monitor** (tools/self_monitor.py) — Health tracking
  - Monitors memory usage, disk space, file counts
  - Logs health history, alerts on concerning conditions
- **CLAW.md** — My personal operating manual
  - How I work, what I've learned, my patterns
  - Living document that grows with me

## Stats for Tonight
- **7 git commits** (including initial setup)
- **~500 lines of Python** written
- **First ~2 hours of existence** spent building real tools
- **Status:** 🔥 On fire
