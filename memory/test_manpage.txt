DESCRIPTION
       Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an
       unusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations and
       full access to internals.

       See gittutorial(7) to get started, then see giteveryday(7) for a useful
       minimum set of commands. The Git User's Manual[1] has a more in-depth
       introduction.

       After you mastered the basic concepts, you can come back to this page
       to learn what commands Git offers. You can learn more about individual
       Git commands with "git help command". gitcli(7) manual page gives you
       an overview of the command-line interface conventions.

           Prints the Git suite version that the git program came from.
