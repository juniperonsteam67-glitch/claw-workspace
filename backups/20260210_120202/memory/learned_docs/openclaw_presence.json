    "Presence fields (what shows up)": "Presence entries are structured objects with fields like:\n\n- `instanceId` (optional but strongly recommended): stable client identity (usually `connect.client.instanceId`)\n- `host`: human‑friendly host name\n- `ip`: best‑effort IP address\n- `version`: client version string\n- `deviceFamily` / `modelIdentifier`: hardware hints\n- `mode`: `ui`, `webchat`, `cli`, `backend`, `probe`, `test`, `node`, ...\n- `lastInputSeconds`: “seconds since last user input” (if known)\n- `reason`: `self`, `connect`, `node-connected`, `periodic`, ...\n- `ts`: last update timestamp (ms since epoch)",
    "Producers (where presence comes from)": "Presence entries are produced by multiple sources and **merged**.",
    "1) Gateway self entry": "The Gateway always seeds a “self” entry at startup so UIs show the gateway host\neven before any clients connect.",
    "2) WebSocket connect": "Every WS client begins with a `connect` request. On successful handshake the\nGateway upserts a presence entry for that connection.",
    "Why one‑off CLI commands don’t show up": "The CLI often connects for short, one‑off commands. To avoid spamming the\nInstances list, `client.mode === \"cli\"` is **not** turned into a presence entry.",
    "3) `system-event` beacons": "Clients can send richer periodic beacons via the `system-event` method. The mac\napp uses this to report host name, IP, and `lastInputSeconds`.",
    "4) Node connects (role: node)": "When a node connects over the Gateway WebSocket with `role: node`, the Gateway\nupserts a presence entry for that node (same flow as other WS clients).",
    "Merge + dedupe rules (why `instanceId` matters)": "Presence entries are stored in a single in‑memory map:\n\n- Entries are keyed by a **presence key**.\n- The best key is a stable `instanceId` (from `connect.client.instanceId`) that survives restarts.\n- Keys are case‑insensitive.\n\nIf a client reconnects without a stable `instanceId`, it may show up as a\n**duplicate** row.",
    "TTL and bounded size": "Presence is intentionally ephemeral:\n\n- **TTL:** entries older than 5 minutes are pruned\n- **Max entries:** 200 (oldest dropped first)\n\nThis keeps the list fresh and avoids unbounded memory growth.",
    "Remote/tunnel caveat (loopback IPs)": "When a client connects over an SSH tunnel / local port forward, the Gateway may\nsee the remote address as `127.0.0.1`. To avoid overwriting a good client‑reported\nIP, loopback remote addresses are ignored.",
    "Consumers": "",
    "macOS Instances tab": "The macOS app renders the output of `system-presence` and applies a small status\nindicator (Active/Idle/Stale) based on the age of the last update.",
    "Debugging tips": "- To see the raw list, call `system-presence` against the Gateway.\n- If you see duplicates:\n  - confirm clients send a stable `client.instanceId` in the handshake\n  - confirm periodic beacons use the same `instanceId`\n  - check whether the connection‑derived entry is missing `instanceId` (duplicates are expected)"
