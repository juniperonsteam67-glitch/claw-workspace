        "Using Lists as Queues \u00b6 It is also possible to use a list as a queue, where the first element added is the first element retrieved (\u201cfirst-in, first-out\u201d); however, lists are not efficient for this purpose.",
        "The del statement \u00b6 There is a way to remove an item from a list given its index instead of its value: the del statement.",
        "Since Python is an evolving language, other sequence data types may be added.",
        "This allows creating customized lists more concisely and improves code readability and efficiency."
